1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
________________________

  Linux - Ubuntu 16.03 LTS
  Architecture - 64 bit


  Make sure your system has all recent updates!
    sudo apt update


  Install QtSerialPort
    sudo apt install libqt5serialport5-dev


________________________
2. BUILDING AND RUNNING
________________________

  Download and unpack the latest release:
    https://github.com/SCCapstone/Sense-Able/releases
    tar -zxvf sense-able-release.tar.gz


  Run our execution script:
    cd Release/build_deploy/
    sudo ./runSenseAbleGui


________________________
3. TESTING
________________________
In order to run tests, just run the ./leddargui executable in the
build-leddargui-Desktop-Debug/ debug directory.

We give an overview of how one should make their own tests:

_________________
UNIT TESTING:
_________________
We use the googletest testing framework.

In order to test a function, use the following template (within the
unittestsuite.cpp file):

TEST (TestCase, TestName) {
	EXPECT_EQ(expected_value, function(args...))
}
_________________
BEHAVIOR TESTING:
_________________
We use the QTest testing framework to simulate clicks and keypresses
on the gui.

In order to test a behavior, use the following template (within the
QtBehaviorTestSuite.cpp file):

void QtBehaviorTestSuite::testName() {
	MainWindow window;
	
	QSignalSpy spy(&window, SIGNAL(nameOfSignalToTest()));
	QWidget widget = window.findChild<WidgetType>("name of widget");
	
	// Simulate use of the widget here
	
	// We should make this a separate function; less typing:
	cout << "testStreamButtonClicked:  ";
    if (spy.count() == 1) {
        cout << "SUCCESS";
    } else {
        cout << "FAILURE";
    }
    cout << endl;

}

This function sets up a spy to track whether the given signal emits.
We then get the widget on the screen to do something to, and simulate
that widget (i.e. do a keypress or a mouse click, etc.).  See the
QTest documentation on how to simulate a widget.  Finally, we output
whether the simulation was actually performed ("SUCCESS") or not
("FAILURE").

4. WARNINGS
________________________
When using the record function, running the program as sudo with grant exclusive permission to leddar recordings to root. To avoid this, run only as regular user. 

If the leddar seems to not have USB permissions, no detections are reported while streaming or no leddar recording is generated and the Leddar is plugged in. Try unplugging the leddar, re runnnig install-senseable, and then plugging the leddar back in. If all else fails, restart your computer.
